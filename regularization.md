This fork was originally created to investigate a strange effect described in

https://github.com/AlliedToasters/synapses/issues/1

The first experimental notebook confirmes the conjecture stated in that issue:

We also see that this level of regularization makes the model generalize nicely, while without regularization it tends to somewhat overfit, cf. the original Jupiter notebook:
